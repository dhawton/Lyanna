Lyanna is a slim yet elegant PHP framework designed to allow quicker development and deployment of websites.  It provides
a MVC layout out of the box, with routing, sessions, and other basic tasks developed and ready to go.

## TODO:

- Develop SQL ORM with Query Builder
- Modify routing handler to allow custom routes, currently it handles as /Controller/Method or /Controller.  If Method is missing,
 assumes Index.  If both are missing, assumes /Home/Index.
