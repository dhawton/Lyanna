            Welcome to the Jacksonville ARTCC website. This website is for a group of online hobbyists who partake in
            simulated flying and air traffic control on the VATSIM network. The Jacksonville ARTCC owns a large chunk of
            airspace spanning from the Pensacola Naval Air Station complex, to Jacksonville International airport;
            Charleston Air Force Base/International Airport, down to Orlando International airport. The procedures we use
            mirror, to an extent, those utilized by real world air traffic control. At no time, however, should a procedure,
            chart, or other information contained on this website be used for real world navigation.
